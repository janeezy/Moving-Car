# moving car

Welcome to Code With Jane Duru. In this article, we Create a Moving Car Animation. We use only HTML and CSS coding for Moving Car Animation projects.

In this project we will create a car and using the css animations concepts which helps in add the animations in the car.

Hope you like the code so let’s start with a basic HTML structure for the Moving Car Animation.

The div element with the class “car” will establish the main container for the construction of the car, thus we need to make a variety of containers using this tag to build the structure of our car. Then, we’ll make a few subdivisions inside the main container, using them to assemble the various car parts. like top, front, back, left, and right headlamps; adding wheels within our car; and ultimately, other features.

Following that, we’ll make the three distinct cloud divs.

There is all the html code for the Moving Car Animation. Now, you can see output without css, then we write css for the Moving Car Animation.
