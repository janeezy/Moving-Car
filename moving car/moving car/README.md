# moving car

Welcome to Code With Jane Duru. In this article, we Create a Moving Car Animation. We use only HTML and CSS coding for Moving Car Animation projects.

In this project we will create a car and using the css animations concepts which helps in add the animations in the car.

Hope you like the code so let’s start with a basic HTML structure for the Moving Car Animation.

The div element with the class “car” will establish the main container for the construction of the car, thus we need to make a variety of containers using this tag to build the structure of our car. Then, we’ll make a few subdivisions inside the main container, using them to assemble the various car parts. like top, front, back, left, and right headlamps; adding wheels within our car; and ultimately, other features.

Following that, we’ll make the three distinct cloud divs.

There is all the html code for the Moving Car Animation. Now, you can see output without css, then we write css for the Moving Car Animation.
Next, we will predefine the colours for the car’s body and the backdrop colour using the root selector. Then, using the body tag selector, we will set the background as a linear gradient, and using the overflow property, we will hide the overflow elements. Finally, we will use the html property to set the height to “100%.

The position will now be set to “absolute” using the class selector (.car), and a 70% space and a 50% space will be added using the top and left attributes.

After setting the position in accordance with the top structure using the class selector for the car’s top, body, and bulb, we will then center the vehicle.

We’ll just finish up by adding some clouds to our project. With the help of the class selector (.cloud), we will set the position to “absolute,” add a top space using the top property, a width of 20 vm, and a height of 10 vm using the width and height values. Next, we will alter the clouds’ breadth and height using their before and after characteristics.
